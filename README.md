# Portafolio Elisa React js

elisa's portfolio in this project I used new technologies such as styled components, which allows me to style my components and at the same time define them. I was able to condition their values as we want and it is very dynamic to work with this library.
I worked with the UI in figma built by the educational platform [leonidasesteban.com](https://leonidasesteban.com/)
